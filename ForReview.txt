A report on my first WekiWork Probation project. 

I had a few challenges:
    1. implementing the z-index
    2. using media queries
    3. using hover on my buttons and links

I noticed the app wasn't mobile responsive so i tried to twig it
by using media queries but i wasn't able to make it work.

I added a few changes:
    1. a nav bar color.
    2. a large products and services section.
    3. the nav-links can navigate to their various web sections.
    4. each section fills up the screen of the PC, makes it a little bit unique.

Things i learnt from building this website:
    1. i now understand how to use negative values better.
    2. z-index is less confusing.
    3. i undertand using flex and position better.

I really enjoyed designing this though it took longer than i imagined.
